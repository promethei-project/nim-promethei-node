## Progressive async PrometheiTree builder.
##
## ``buildAsync`` consumes an ``AsyncIter[Cid]`` one leaf at a time and
## compresses layer pairs in parallel batches on a ``Taskpool``, delegating
## the batching machinery to the generic layer builder in ``../asyncbuilder``.
## The returned ``PrometheiTree`` has layers that are byte-identical to the
## synchronous ``PrometheiTree.init`` build, so proofs and root CIDs match
## exactly.
##
## Leaf validation (multihash codec, digest length) lives here, not in the
## generic core: the core sees only validated digests, surfaced as
## failed/successful ``?!`` items.
