## Generic progressive async Merkle tree layer builder.
##
## ``buildLayersAsync`` consumes an ``AsyncIter[?!H]`` one leaf at a time and
## compresses layer pairs in parallel batches on a ``Taskpool``, returning the
## layers of the tree.  Family adapters (``PrometheiTree.buildAsync``,
## ``Poseidon2Tree.buildAsync``) validate leaves, pick the compressor, and
## construct their concrete tree type on top of these layers.
##
## Key semantics are preserved from ``merkleTreeWorker``:
##
## - pairs at level 0 use ``K.KeyBottomLayer``, pairs above use ``K.KeyNone``
## - an odd tail compresses its last node with ``zero`` (node LEFT,
##   zero RIGHT) using ``K.KeyOddAndBottomLayer`` at level 0 and ``K.KeyOdd``
##   above
## - a single node at a non-bottom level is the root and is never compressed
##
## Only complete consecutive pairs are ever compressed eagerly; the odd-tail
## determination is deferred until the stream ends, exactly like the sync
## worker's final pass.  Batch results are appended strictly in seqNum order,
## so the layers do not depend on worker completion order.
