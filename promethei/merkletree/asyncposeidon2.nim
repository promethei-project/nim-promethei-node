## Progressive async Poseidon2Tree builder.
##
## ``buildAsync`` consumes an ``AsyncIter[Poseidon2Hash]`` one leaf at a time
## and compresses layer pairs in parallel batches on a ``Taskpool``,
## delegating the batching machinery to the generic layer builder in
## ``../asyncbuilder``.  The returned ``Poseidon2Tree`` has layers that are
## identical to the synchronous ``Poseidon2Tree.init`` build, so proofs
## verify exactly.
##
## This module exists separately from ``poseidon2.nim`` so the sync-only
## consumers of that module (slots, proofs) do not inherit chronos/taskpools;
## adapters import it explicitly when they need the async builder.
